# give-your-eyes-a-break
A web extension for my personal use on firefox. It reminds me that I need to take a break from watching the screen every twenty minutes, by overlaying a cute cat picture like so.


## Instructions to make it work 

Will publish it to mozilla soon, but for now it needs to be added as a temporary add-on.
