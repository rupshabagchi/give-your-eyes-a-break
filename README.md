# Give your eyes a break
A web extension for my personal use on firefox. It reminds me that I need to take a break from watching the screen every twenty minutes, by overlaying a cute cat picture like so.

## Getting Started

Will publish it to mozilla soon, but for now it needs to be added as a `temporary add-on`.

To download it,

```
git clone https://github.com/rupshabagchi/give-your-eyes-a-break.git
about:debugging -> temporary add-on -> select rest.js //On the browser
```
