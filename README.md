# give-your-eyes-a-break
A web extension for my personal use on firefox. It reminds me that I need to take a break from watching the screen every twenty minutes, by overlaying a cute cat picture like so.


## Getting Started

Will publish it to mozilla soon, but for now it needs to be added as a `temporary add-on`.

To make it work, this repo can be forked or downloaded as a zip.

```
//On the browser
about:debugging -> temporary add-on -> select rest.js
```
